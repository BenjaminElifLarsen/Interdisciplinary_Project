2) In Postman select new -> WebSocket Request
3) Enter wss://localhost:7107/MessageHub into Server Url
4) Press Connect
5) Send the following message {"protocol":"json","version":1}
	Messages must include the termination character, this goes for all messages
	The response '{}' should be received in the 'Message' section. 
	After this the 'Messages' section will start to receive '{"type":6}'. This is a ping from the server to check if the client is still there
6) Post the following message {"arguments":[{ "userId": 1, "eukaryoteId": 1, "moment": "2023-03-08T11:12:21.850", "latitude": 20, "longtitude":21, "title": "hub", "text": "transmitted from postman"}],"invocationId":"0","target":"Post","type":1}
	If it is valid (after validation rules in the API), a response is send to all connected clients else just the client who send the message who receives a string array
	The following, if valid, will be recived '{"type":1,"target":"MessagePosted","arguments":[]}' followed by '{"type":3,"invocationId":"0","result":null}'.
	The message '{"type":1,"target":"MessagePosted","arguments":[]}' is the response transmitted to all clients. 
		If the message does not look like the above it indicates that the transmitted responnse has been updated, since the writting of this text.
	If the message is invalid something like this message '{"type":1,"target":"MessageErr","arguments":[["The user id is invalid.","The lifeform id is invalid.","The title is invalid."]]} followered by {"type":3,"invocationId":"0","result":null}' will be received
	The "target" value, "Post", in the message is the method that is calling in the hub.
